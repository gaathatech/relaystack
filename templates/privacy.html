    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This is a generic privacy policy template for the RelayStack demo app (Nexora). It is provided for convenience only and should be reviewed by your legal counsel before use.</p>

    <h3>What we collect</h3>
    <p>We may collect telephone numbers that you provide and logs of message delivery for debugging and audit purposes. These are stored locally on the server in the `static/logs` folder.</p>

    <h3>How we use data</h3>
    <p>Numbers and message logs are used only to perform the requested message deliveries and to provide you with a downloadable log file. We do not share the data with third parties unless required by law or with your explicit consent.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Protecting data is important. This demo app does not offer production-grade security by default—deployments should use HTTPS, access controls, and proper secrets management.</p>

    <p class="small">Note: This policy is a template. Please consult legal counsel for a production-ready policy.</p>
